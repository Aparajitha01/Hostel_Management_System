# Hostel_Management_System
Our project modernizes hostel management via an online system for registration, student details, and facilities. Automation streamlines room allocation, attendance, and reporting, easing staff load and student time. Digital records enhance accuracy, accessibility, and simplify management for improved efficiency.
